This study achieves fire detection by receiving data from sensors, processing it using fuzzy logic, and determining the presence of a fire. Additionally, it successfully records images obtained from the OV7670 camera module and uses artificial intelligence to decide whether a fire has occurred. Two separate experiments yielded successful results.


The obtained image from the OV7670 camera module was used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This trained model was then given camera images, and fire detection was performed.
